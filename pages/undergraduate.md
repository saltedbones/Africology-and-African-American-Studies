### Bachelor of Arts in Africology and African American Studies
The Africology and African American Studies program at Temple University provides undergraduates with the opportunity to critically examine and interpret the experiences, traditions and dynamics of people of African descent. Africology, an interdisciplinary discipline, studies the culture of Africans and the African diaspora. Students who major in African American Studies are guided through scholarly reflection by leaders in the field.

Our curriculum stresses the skills that employers value - critical thinking, persuasive writing and problem solving skills. Students are prepared to take roles of effective agency, participation and leadership in their communities and professions.  You'll be exposed to Africana theory and encouraged to engage in research and service outside the classroom walls. If you study with us, you'll join an energetic group of scholars and learners who seek to continue what began more than forty years ago.

### Minor in Africology and African American Studies
Regardless of what your major is, a minor in African American studies adds an interdisciplinary depth to your main course of study. The minor allows students interested in business, the sciences, engineering, government and social services to present an exceptional academic background to prospective employers.

### Financial Aid and Scholarships
If you need help paying for college, you aren’t alone. Most college students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. Learn more about getting financial aid at the Student Financial Services.
